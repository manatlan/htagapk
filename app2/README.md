# This is an "Android TV" app example

It just display 3 buttons. You can navigate with your android tv remote, and play the 3 movies.
It will run the movie in a vlc intent (you'll need to have vlc installed)

It shows you :

 - how to interact with android ecosystem (here to start an intent/app from htag)
 - you how to set presplash & banner (icon tv).

It targets "armeabi-v7a" build !

NOTE :

 - sorry: videos/urls are not really playable on all "android tv". But you'll get the idea ;-) (TODO: need to find urls video playable in any contexts)
